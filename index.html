								<h2 class="major">What It Is</h2>
								<p>The open access movement refers to making information, research and literature available to anyone online without any financial, legal or technical barriers. Open access publishing’s have two versions – gratis and libre. Gratis open access allows people to access internet resources without having to pay, however, the user does not have the right to make copies, distribute or modify any work. Libre open access resources are also available free of charge, with additional user rights such as reusing and remixing the research to some degree, depending on what the license permits. </p>
								<p>The majority of resources published on the internet is locked behind barriers, forcing people to pay money to access research and science instead of allowing everyone to access information. This is why the open access movement was created to change this by allowing access to knowledge published on the internet without a cost. This would mean people would have access to a larger body of research Access to knowledge is a privilege that is not shared by everyone, there is a long way to go to change this.</p>

									The main aim of the open access movement is to improve public access to research and resources so that it can be shared with people and improve collaboration of research information. This also allows authors to hold the rights and be commended and payed accordingly for their work. Publishing open access is important for the author as they are the main beneficiary of the publication and receive benefits from being more widely read, cited and acknowledged for their work. This video explains how authors are benefited by publishing open access.
